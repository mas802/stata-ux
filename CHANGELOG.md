# 0.4.0-beta (unreleased)



# 0.3.0-beta (09/01/2016)

first full functional release within one jar file supports smart suggestions and
the custom commands /help, /graph, /est and /edit. The last opens the given file
in a ace editor.

## known limitations

- not really usable without a split keyboard (e.g. currently iPad pro) due to
Apple's interpretation of what a viewport and a absolut position on a touch
device should do.
